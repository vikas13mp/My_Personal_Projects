        <p>Before making a purchase, ~80% of customers read online reviews or comments on products and services.
            However, some of these reviews can be fraudulent as promoting certain products or depreciating them and, as
            a result, misguide buyers. Indeed, Google announced that in 2020, they detected 40 billion spam reviews
            daily.Content creators get paid to create fake online reviews, and they promote or depreciate certain
            products in their reviews.

            Creating reviews manually is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly. Therefore, automated algorithms
            (e.g., Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) methods) are applied to create fake
            reviews. Contrary to human-generated reviews, machine-generated reviews are produced through text
            generation, which can generate reviews on a large scale.

            Fake review detection can be incredibly helpful for customers because it helps them make more informed
            purchasing decisions. When customers are researching products or services online, they often rely on reviews
            to get an idea of the quality and reliability of a particular product or service. However, fake reviews can
            skew the overall rating and mislead customers into making a purchase that they might not have made
            otherwise.</p>
